# v0.3.0: Core Architecture & Type Safety

## Developer's Perspective

This is the "heavy lifting" phase. I'm tackling the two most common sources of runtime errors: missing environment variables and broken translations. By enforcing strict type safety on both, I'm eliminating entire classes of bugs.

## Work Checklist

### 1. T3 Env (Environment Variables)

- **What**: Implementing `@t3-oss/env-nextjs` and `zod` to validate `process.env`.
- **Why**: Traditionally, if I forget `DATABASE_URL` in production, the app crashes obscurely at runtime. With T3 Env, the app **refuses to build** or start without valid env vars, giving me a clear error message immediately. It provides fully typed `env.DATABASE_URL` autocomplete.

### 2. Internationalization (i18n)

- **What**: Integrating `next-intl` with App Router support.
- **Why**:
  - **Performance**: `next-intl` is lighter than `i18next`.
  - **Server Components**: It works seamlessly with RSC (React Server Components).
  - **Crowdin**: I'm designing the workflow so that JSON files can be easily synced with a translation management system like Crowdin, keeping translators and developers in sync.

### Technical Implementation Details

- Create `src/env.ts` to define the schema.
- Middleware setup to handle locale routing (e.g., `/en/about` vs `/id/about`).
- `messages/en.json` file structure for scalable translation keys.
