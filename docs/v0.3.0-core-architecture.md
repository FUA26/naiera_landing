# v0.3.0: Core Architecture & Type Safety

## Developer's Perspective

This is the "heavy lifting" phase. I'm tackling one of the most common sources of runtime errors: missing environment variables. By enforcing strict type safety on environment variables, I'm eliminating entire classes of bugs.

## Work Checklist

### 1. T3 Env (Environment Variables)

- **What**: Implementing `@t3-oss/env-nextjs` and `zod` to validate `process.env`.
- **Why**: Traditionally, if I forget `DATABASE_URL` in production, the app crashes obscurely at runtime. With T3 Env, the app **refuses to build** or start without valid env vars, giving me a clear error message immediately. It provides fully typed `env.DATABASE_URL` autocomplete.
- **Status**: ✅ Completed

### Technical Implementation Details

- Created `env.ts` to define the schema with server and client variables
- Updated `next.config.ts` to import env for build-time validation
- Enhanced `.env.example` with comprehensive documentation
- Implemented typed env usage in `app/layout.tsx`
- Tested validation with invalid and missing variables

## Future Enhancements

Internationalization (i18n) with `next-intl` has been deferred to a future release to focus on core architecture improvements first.
