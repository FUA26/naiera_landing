# v0.2.0: UI Development Environment

## Developer's Perspective

Now that the foundation is solid, I'm shifting focus to the visual layer. Developer Experience isn't just about linting; it's about how fast I can build UIs. I'm doubling down on Tailwind CSS for utility-first speed and Storybook for component isolation.

## Work Checklist

### 1. Verify Tailwind CSS 4

- **What**: Ensuring the new Tailwind v4 engine is correctly configured in `postcss.config.mjs` and `globals.css`.
- **Why**: Tailwind v4 brings significant performance improvements. I need to make sure we're getting those benefits and that the VSCode extension supports it using the new `app` directory structure.

### 2. Setup Storybook

- **What**: Installing Storybook and configuring it to recognize Tailwind classes.
- **Why**:
  - **Isolation**: I want to build a `Button` or `Card` without running the entire Next.js app.
  - **Documentation**: Storybook serves as a living style guide.
  - **Testing**: It helps verify that components work in different states (loading, error, empty) visually.

### Technical Implementation Details

- `npx storybook@latest init` to scaffold the setup.
- Update `.storybook/preview.ts` to import `globals.css` so Tailwind works in stories.
- Add an example story to prove it works.
