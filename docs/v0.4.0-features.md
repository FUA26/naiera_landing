# v0.4.0: Features & Optimization

## Developer's Perspective

With the architecture in place, I'm adding the standard features that every production app needs but often gets forgotten until the last minute: Forms, Logging, SEO, and Sitemap.

## Work Checklist

### 1. Form Handling (React Hook Form + Zod)

- **What**: Creating a standardized way to build forms.
- **Why**: Forms are hard. State management, validation, error handling, and accessibility need to be consistent. Zod schemas allow me to share validation logic between the client (form) and server (API action).

### 2. Logging (LogTape)

- **What**: Replacing `console.log` with structured logging using `logtape`.
- **Why**: `console.log` is fine for debugging localhost, but useless in production. I need structured logs (JSON) that I can pipe to a service like Better Stack to search and alert on errors.

### 3. SEO & Metadata

- **What**: Leveraging Next.js 15's Metadata API for dynamic SEO tags, plus generating `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt`.
- **Why**: A beautiful site is useless if Google can't find it. I want SEO to be "baked in" so that every page automatically gets the correct OG tags and canonical URLs.

### Technical Implementation Details

- `sitemap.ts` dynamic route generation.
- Reusable `Seo` component or utility function to merge default metadata with page-specific data.
